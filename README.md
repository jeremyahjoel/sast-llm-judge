# Multi-LLM Judge SAST System - Vulnerability Assessment Results

This repository showcases the capabilities and results of our advanced Static Application Security Testing (SAST) system that leverages a multi-LLM judge architecture to identify and assess vulnerabilities in popular deliberately vulnerable web applications.

Please note the PoC capabilities was limited to:

- $2 USD per repo scan (which limit the token usage for all three models) to prevent the model to hallucinate / trapped in loophole
- The system prompts provided to the Claude Code explicitly command the model to find the top 10 most risky issues and spent most of token to dynamically perform trace/track analysis

Any increase in these 2 conditions would lead to better context window and is expected to perform better in providing more stable, thoughtful and deeper result.

## üîç System Architecture

Detailed explaination on Architecture and PoC: https://jo14.medium.com/beyond-sast-building-a-multi-llm-judge-for-context-aware-security-analysis-86f6783e661d

Our SAST system implements a novel approach that combines multiple Large Language Models in a judge architecture:


### Core Components:

1. **Code Analysis Pipeline**
   - Repository analysis via Claude Code
   - Context-aware prompt generation with Claude API
   - Dynamic analysis with MVC pattern recognition
   - Initial vulnerability identification

2. **Multi-LLM Judge System**
   - Independent assessment by DeepSeek (r1) and OpenAI (o1) models
   - Cross-model reasoning dialogue
   - Impartial synthesis by Claude API to eliminate biases

3. **Evaluation & Integration**
   - Final vulnerability confirmation
   - False positive elimination
   - Security ticket generation
   - JIRA and DefectDojo integration

## üìä Applications Under Test

Our system is designed to scan a variety of deliberately vulnerable applications to demonstrate effectiveness across different tech stacks, vulnerability types, and application architectures.
